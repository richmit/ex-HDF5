A few simple HDF5 programs (for API version >1.8.0) illustrating the
most basic, and commonly used, functionality of the HDF5 library. They
should be useful for the HDF5 beginner.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/HDF5.html).

Have fun!
